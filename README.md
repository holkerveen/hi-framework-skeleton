# Hi Framework Skeleton

A project skeleton for [Hi Framework](https://github.com/holkerveen/hi-framework) applications.

## Documentation

For information on using this skeleton to build applications, see the [Hi Framework documentation](https://github.com/holkerveen/hi-framework).

## Developing the Skeleton

This repository serves as a template for new Hi Framework projects. To modify the skeleton:

- Update dependencies in `composer.json`
- Modify the directory structure and boilerplate files as needed
- Update `Application.php` in `src/` to extend or customize framework behavior
- Test changes by creating a new project from the modified skeleton

The skeleton is kept minimal to provide a clean starting point for new applications.
